# Virtue for Vice
A HackUSU 2025 local-multiplayer RPG

Created by Kade Angell, Matthew Webecke, Tyson Buxton, and Reece Nielson

## Concept

Twin brothers, both princes, despise each other and like the same princess

When practicing latin, they accidentally summoned a demon who hates beauty

The demon kidnapped the princess and gave them an opportunity to rescue her by traversing his dungeon

Inside, they can choose to sacrifice some of their good looks for more power to help them get to the end of the dungeon to rescue the princess

The princess will only choose the best-looking prince, so there is a balancing act between getting more power to finish the dungeon and remaining good looking enough for the princess to like you

If you die, the demon will extract some of your good looks to resurrect you

There IS PvP. TBD: decide whether kiling the other guy does something to balance things out or what's up

Getting to the end of the dungeon means the princess gets to choose which brother she wants to go out with

## Tech Stack

* Godot! for the game engine
* Aseprite for making sprites
